# entree

Entree is a rogue-lite where a struggling chef tries to turn their hole in the wall restaurant into a 5 star experience while trying to avoid going bust in the process. The game is broken down into three part cycles. The first part is a timed dash through a kitchen supply warehouse where you purchase ingredients and equipment that will modify your run. The second part is placing equipment, choosing the menu, and calling staff to work. The third part is running service at the restaurant with the ingredients and equipment you purchased. Equipment persists between runs, but ingredients only last a single service. A successful service means that your funds will enable you to purchase better equipment, better ingredients, and hire better and more staff.

## Phases

### Shopping

Every run begins with a shopping phase. During the shopping phase you have a short window to walk around the shop and see what is in stock. After that you will have one minute to purchase any items from the shop. Equipment and ingredients are on a rotation and only some items consistently show up in the shop.

### Prepping

The follow up phase is placing the ingredients and equipment in the restaurant. These can be placed anywhere but cannot be moved during service. Staff also can be called in to work the service during this phase. New staff can be hired as well.

### Service

Service is using the ingredients, equipment, and staff to serve customers. Equipment can be passive or active. Ingredients do not run out but normally do not last past a single service. Staff can be assigned to single or multiple tasks while the chef must be manually controlled by the player. The general customer flow is to enter the restaurant, be seated, order, eat, and leave. Some customers/parties will vary in how much they order, how long they eat, and how long they stay afterwards.
